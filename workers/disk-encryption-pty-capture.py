#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Run a command inside a real pty — so interactive terminal behavior (echo
suppression for password prompts, etc.) works exactly as if run directly —
while logging everything the command outputs to a file.

This process is expected to already be running as root (invoked via `sudo
python3 ...` by the caller). It creates the logfile itself, with O_EXCL, so
there is never a point where a file created by one user is opened by
another — no DAC/mount-namespace/SELinux edge case to hit, and no chown-back
needed. The caller reads and removes the file afterwards via `sudo cat` /
`sudo shred`, since it remains root-owned for its whole lifecycle.

Deliberately invoked as a file, not piped into `python3 -` via stdin: doing
that would tie up fd 0 with the script source itself, leaving pty.spawn()'s
stdin-forwarding with nothing live to relay and no way to reach the child.

Called from shell/disk-encryption.sh (workbench-security).
